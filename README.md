# CSU_WK9

I was able to deploy dionaea, suricata, and shockpot honeypot VMs.  The dionaea honeypot began to get attacked immediately after it was stood up.  I did not register any attacks on the other two honeypots, even after I ran NMAP against them from my host machine.  Probably misconfigured them.  

I ran into some issues initally while standing up the mhn-admin box
